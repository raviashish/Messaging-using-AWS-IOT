# Messaging-using-AWS-IOT
Send a message with a click of a button !!
It is an node.js code. No library is defined. All the library has to be uploaded externally based on your requirement
This project involves sending messages to the predefined mobile number,according to the type of click in the IOT button.
This project is suitable for Amazon's AWS IOT button.The button has three clicks - Single, Double and Long Click.
Single click will send a "help" message. Double click will send a "emergency" message.
Long click will send a "Safe" message
You can use this code and configure it to send a message to your near ones.The code is written in node.js format.
You can connect a trigger to this code using AWS IOT/AWS Lambda.The trigger I have used an Amzaon IOT button as my trigger.

Any questions and feedback is Welcome.

Have a Good Day!!Enjoy coding!!
